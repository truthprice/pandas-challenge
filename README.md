# Pandas-Challenge

## Description

The motivation and purpose of this project was to review school data and create outputs that help us to compare schools based on a variety of categories. By creating this project we are able to compare several schools from this school district using their school testing data. 

## Results and Conclusions

### Results
The results of this project included a variety of tables. These tables include:
- District Summary
- School Summary
- Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type

### Conclusions
Based on the tables created, we are able to see important information. Of note, is that schools performed better on the reading assessment when compared to math. Additionally, the top five performing schools were all charter schools as opposed to district schools. Lastly, schools that spent less money per student were able to generate better overall schools.
